    questionText: 'Why shall I trust ChicEmpire with my investment?',
    answerText:
      `The ChicEmpire team possesses a clear understanding of its strengths and areas for improvement. Our collective experience has yielded favorable returns on asset acquisitions, yet we acknowledge the superior outcomes achieved by industry experts. This realization drives our strategic collaboration with renowned investment entities like The Watch Fund. Backed by decades of watch-related transactions and an impressive track record of delivering average annual returns of up to 20%, they enjoy the trust of clients for managing significant asset portfolios.  


      When you invest in an asset through us, you secure a stake in an asset secured by a 3rd party trustee. Notably, this setup isolates the invested asset from those of ChicEmpire or its associates. This separation serves as a safeguard – in an improbable scenario of ChicEmpire's bankruptcy, ensuring the complete protection of your share in the tangible asset. Your investment, thus, remains secure and insulated from any such adverse occurrences.`,

    questionText: 'How does ChicEmpire work?',
    answerText:
      `Our mission is to shatter the exclusivity barriers that have historically restricted alternative assets to the wealthy few. To make this possible, ChicEmpire joins forces with leading industry experts worldwide, leveraging their profound insights to pinpoint the most exceptional investment prospects for our community.  Vital information about ongoing and completed investment opportunities is easily accessible through our web applications.

      
      Ahead of the crowdfunding campaign's launch, you can secure shares in advance, ensuring a priority slot when the investment phase commences.  As the crowdfunding campaign goes live, purchasing shares becomes seamless, whether through direct bank transfers or credit cards. Upon achieving the funding goal, you become a shareholder of the chosen asset. Your share allocation correlates with your order size. The partner acquires the asset, validated by an external authority, and the asset becomes the collective legal ownership of all shareholders. It's then securely stored and insured via our esteemed partners or trustee.
      
      

      After a pre-defined appreciation period, our partner divests the asset within six months to their network of buyers and collectors. If an offer surpasses the predefined target value increase before the period concludes, an early sale is feasible. The net returns are then distributed proportionally among the legal shareholders of the asset.  At ChicEmpire, safeguarding your trust and security is paramount. We ensure each investor's identity verification and payment security through a reputable Payment Service Provider. Your confidence and safety remain our steadfast commitment.`
